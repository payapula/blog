## Hooks Closure

## Introduction to Closures

https://codesandbox.io/s/duplicate-vb76n

```javascript
function App(count) {
  console.log('Counter initialized with ' + count);
  return function print() {
    console.log(++count);
  };
}

let print = App(1);
print();
print();
print();

print = App(5);
print();
print();
```

The above function is a simple example of **closure** in JavaScript. The console output is as below.

```
Counter initialized with 1 
2
3
4
Counter initialized with 5 
6
7
```

If you can get it then great! I will go ahead and explain what is happening here. The `App` function returns another
function `print`. This function is called as higher order function in JS. Any function that returns another function
or that takes a funciton as argument are called **Higher order functions** in JS. This is possible because funcitons
are first class citizens in JS.

```javascript
function App(count) {
  console.log('Counter initialized with ' + count);
  return function print() {
    console.log(++count);
  };
}
```

The retuned function `print` **closes over** the variable `count` which is from its outer scope. This closing is referred
to as **closure**. When we call the `App` function, we get the `print` function in return.

```javascript
let print = App(1);
```

The `App` function gets count as 1 and returns `print` which simply increases the count and logs it. So each time when we call
`print` the count is incremented and printed.

*So, what is the purpose of the returned functions in the real applications?*

## Cleanup Functions

Consider the below function

```javascript
function App(name) {
  console.log(`Welcome, ${name}!`);

  return () => {
    console.clear();
  };
}

App("Jack"); //logs: Welcome, Jack! 
```

This simply prints _Welcome, Jack!_. Instead of simply calling it, lets store the function returned from `App`
in a variable `cleanup`

```javascript
let cleanUp = App("Jack");
```

Now, after printing if we call `cleanUp` the console would be cleared!

```javascript
let cleanUp = App("Jack"); //logs: Welcome, Jack! 
cleanUp(); //Clears console!
```

You can't even see the logged data as it is getting cleared immediately. In a real world we would do something like this


```javascript
const unsubscribe =  heavyOperations();

// Do some important logic
// after all done cleanup the resources

unsubscribe();
```

*Alright, what these all has to do with React ?*

## Enough of JS, Lets React!







In order to conditionally execute any logic in the useEffect hook you would place the condition
inside it.

ðŸš« Wrong:

```jsx {1,5}
if(count > 5){ // React would throw a error
  React.useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Count is greater than 5!')
  }, [count]);
}
```

âœ… Right:

```jsx {2,4}
React.useEffect(() => {
  if(count > 5){ 
    console.log('Count is greater than 5!')
  }
}, [count]);
```
