While reviewing the code from my team, I always look for certain items and suggest changes. In the projects I have worked on, I have created documentation for coding standards, which I enforce throughout the codebase. However, it can be challenging to copy the documentation from one place to another. Therefore, I'm writing this post, and it will serve as a base set of coding standards that I enforce on most of the code bases. Please feel free to provide your comments.

## Before We Begin

There are some basic items that we need to put in place in our repository to make the code review process smoother. These include:

- We should not worry about indentation, quotes, and formatting during the code review. These tasks can be handled by tools like **Prettier**.

- We should not worry about suggesting basic things like missing dependencies in useEffect and useCallback, or unused variables. These checks are the responsibility of **ESLint**.

- It is important to set up these tools in the repository and ensure that everyone in the project configures them on their local system. 

I will continue to update this post as I discover new items to add to the list.

## Basics

In all the projects I have worked in, all of them followed Agile practices, they typically use software like JIRA to manage the
[Scrum](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/scrum/). There will be user stories, epics, technical stories etc. 

- It is important to ensure that each story has clear and **well-defined acceptance criteria**. This helps guide the code review process and ensures that the changes being made meet the requirements. If acceptance criteria are not defined or lack clarity, it is recommended to check with the product owner and address them.

- It is beneficial to **tag each pull request to a specific story**. This helps track the progress and link the code changes to the corresponding user story.

- Try to keep the Pull requests as **small** as possible. If a story requires a huge change in the codebase, then it means the story
is not properly broken into individual sub-tasks. Keeping PRs as short as possible will make sure the code review is done as
quickly as possible.

- If you couldn't avoid a huge change for a ticket, then you can follow the practice of raising the **PRs in parts**. For example, if you
are making a change that affects 3 pages/sections of your application. You can raise PR for each section and tag the same story number
to all the PRs. 

```bash noline
Ticket-421 Part 1
Ticket-421 Part 2
Ticket-421 Part 3
```

- Add proper **description** to the Pull Requests. Do not solely rely on the ticket to provide the context for reviewers. Remember, Ticket
will help the product to understand the feature updates and PR descriptions will help the reviewers (and your future self) to understand the 
code changes.

- When raising PRs for bug fix, it should have these items

```bash noline

Issue: <Describe the issue>

Reason: <Root cause of the issue>

Fix Made: <What fix is applied>

Screenshot/Video: <Proof>

Tests Added: Yes / No <If No, then add proper reason of why this fix can't be tested>

```


All these can be enforced by having a [Pull request templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository)

## Code Review

- I typically encourage the team to check out the source branch of the PR and run locally to **test the changes**.

- Use tools like [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) to compare the file changes
right from your code editor. It's easy to spot issues if you are making changes and reviewing changes in the same environment.

- Adding to the above point, the diff that we see in GitHub/Bitbucket, etc. doesn't give you a **full picture of what's happening**. To add more context, you need to open the file in new window to check the changes, instead of that I prefer to review the code in the same
editor that I use to write the code.

- Add a link to commonly followed best practices or coding guidelines and build project-specific standards on top of it. I recommend
[Airbnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) as a base. This has some good rules to start with. 

- Avoid nested ternaries as much as possible. Ternaries make code hard to read.

```jsx noline
function Component({ role, manager }) {
  return role === "admin" ? manager === true ? "Welcome, Boss!" : "Welcome, Admin!" : "Welcome, User!"
}
```

Instead of the above, this can be simplified as below

```jsx noline
function Component({ role, manager }) {
  if(role === "admin") {
    if(manager) {
      return "Welcome, Boss!"
    }
    return "Welcome, Admin!"
  }
  return "Welcome, User!"
}
```

- Prefer [Early returns / Guard Classes](https://medium.com/@timothydan/javascript-guard-clauses-64b999e3240) 

- Set up [absolute imports](https://medium.com/geekculture/making-life-easier-with-absolute-imports-react-in-javascript-and-typescript-bbdab8a8a3a1) in codebase instead of relative URLs. It's easy to move the files without having to update the 
imports.

```jsx noline
import { Button } from "../../../components/button" // ❌ Avoid
import { Button } from "@components/button" // ✅ Good
```

- Do not put hard restrictions on a number of lines in a file. Instead, prefer to have a general guideline
on **number of lines per component**. Though this is debatable, having less number of code for a component makes
it easy to read and maintain.

- Follow proper **file name patterns**, the name of the component and the filename should match, so that it's easy to search and work.

I have seen codebases where everything is a default export with `index.jsx`, and at one point when you are working in multiple files, your
code editor will look not so nice. So, prefer this pattern if it suits your codebase.

```jsx noline
// FILE: src/components/button/button.jsx
function Button() {
  //...
}

export { Button }

// FILE: src/components/button/index.js
export * from "./button"; // re-export everything from button

// FILE: src/pages/login
import { Button } from "@components/button" // Will go to index.js file

```

We can use [new-component utility](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/new-component) to create component file structures like this easily.

- Try to create as many custom hooks as you can, and reuse them throughout the code base. If you are spotting a `useEffect` in a PR, then
it probably could be put into an `use`CustomHook. 

## Providing Feedbacks

Be polite while providing feedback. 

> Remember, we are reviewing the code and not the person.

Check _[Exactly what to say in code reviews](https://read.highgrowthengineer.com/p/exactly-what-to-say-in-code-reviews)_ article on how
to provide feedback during code reviews.

Just posting the excerpt from the above article:

- **“I wonder…”** - Use it to suggest lightly while opening it up for discussion
  - Example: “I wonder if we could use a switch statement here instead of multiple if-else blocks.”

- **“I’m curious…”** - Use it to call out something that may not be great about the current approach
  - Example: “I'm curious about the accessibility of these custom UI components. Do we have something in place to give us guarantees around that?”

- **“What do you think about…”** - Use it to make a direct suggestion while still leaving room for the other person to give their thoughts
  - Example: “What do you think about using `map` here instead of mutating the array for safety?”

- **“What would happen if…”** - Use it when you are pretty sure an edge case is not handled, but you still want to allow the other person to tell you something you’re not aware of.
  - Example: “What would happen if the API returns an error here?”

- **“I noticed… What are your thoughts?”** - Use it if you notice something about the approach that could be better but want to invite feedback on your suggestion
  - Example: “I noticed the other files in this folder have x convention. Should we match that here?”

- **“What > why”** - Use “what” instead of “why” wherever possible. It softens the language to avoid defensiveness.
  - Example: “What’s the reason for adding custom logic here instead of using a library?” is better than “Why did you decide to add custom logic here instead of using a library?”
  
- **Empathizing words > prescriptive words**
  - Check how certain you appear in your statement.
  - Use words like “consider”, “might”, and “could” instead of words like “must”, “have to”, and “should”

## Conclusion

All these are suggestions, and **it's okay to be not strict** about something unless you think it will create some serious issues 
down the line.

Happy Reviewing ! ❤️
