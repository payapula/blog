a documentation for coding standards, which I enforce throughout the codebase. As I move from project to project, it's difficult to take the copy documentation
from one place to another. So, creating the set of coding standard that I enforce here to be accessed at anytime. Feel free to provide your comments."

While reviewing the code from my team, there are some items that I always look for and would suggest some changes. In the projects that I have worked, I always try to create
a documentation for coding standards, which I enforce throughout the codebase. As I move from project to project, it's difficult to take the **copy** the documentation
from one place to another. So, creating the set of coding standard that I enforce here to be accessed at anytime. Feel free to provide your comments.

## Before We Begin

There are some basic items to that we need to put up in our repository to make the code review process smoother.

- We should not be worrying about indendations, "quotes", formatting during the code review. Because these need to be enforced
by the tools like **Prettier**.

- We should not be worrying about suggesting basic things like 'missing deps in useEffect, useCallback', unused variables, etc, as
this is the job of **ESlint**.

- We need to make sure to set these tools in the repository and make sure everyone in the project configures on their system. 

I will try to cover most of the items, and may not be able to cover them all. So, will keep updating this post as and when I find
new things to add.

## Basics

In all the projects I have worked in, all of them followed Agile practices, they typically use software like JIRA to manage the
[Scrum](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/scrum/). There will be user stories, epics, technical stories etc. 

- The first rule of thumb is to make sure the stories (a unit of work) should have **Acceptance Criteria** defined. This influences
the code review process. If it's not defined or if it lacks clarity check with the Product owner and get it addressed.

- The Pull request should be tagged to a story.

- Try to keep the Pull requests as **small** as possible. If a story requires a huge change on the codebase, then it means the story
is not properly broken into individual sub tasks. Keeping PRs as short as possible will make sure the code review is done as
quick as possible.

- If you couldn't avoid a huge change for ticket, then you can follow the practice of raising the **PRs in parts**. For example, if you
are making a change that affects 3 pages/sections of your application. You can raise PR for each section and tag the same story number
to all the PRs. 

```bash noline
Ticket-421 Part 1
Ticket-421 Part 2
Ticket-421 Part 3
```

- Add proper **description** to the Pull Requests. Do not solely rely on the ticket to provide the context for reviewers. Remember, Ticket
will help the product to understand the feature updates and PR descriptions will help the reviewers (and your future self) to understand the 
code changes.

- When raising PRs for bugfix, it should definetly have these items

```bash noline

Issue: <Describe the issue>

Reason: <Root cause of the issue>

Fix Made: <What fix is applied>

Screenshot/Video: <Proof>

Tests Added: Yes / No <If No, then add proper reason of why this fix can't be tested>

```


All these can be enforced by having a [Pull request templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository)

## Code Review

- I typically encourage the team to checkout the source branch of the PR and run locally to **test the changes**.

- Use tools like [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) to compare the file changes
right from your code editor. It's easy to spot issues if you are making changes and reviewing changes in the same environment.

- Adding to the above point, the diff that we see in Github/Bitbucket etc doesn't give you a **full picture of what's happening**. To
add more context, you need to open the file in new window to check the changes, instead of that I prefer to review the code in the same
editor that I use to write the code.

- Add a link to commonly followed best practices or coding guidelines and build project specific standards on top of it. I recommend
[Airbnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) as base. This has some good rules to start with. 

- Avoid nested ternaries as much as possible. Ternaries make code hard to read.

```jsx noline
function Component({ role, manager }) {
  return role === "admin" ? manager === true ? "Welcome, Boss!" : "Welcome, Admin!" : "Welcome, User!"
}
```

```jsx noline
function Component({ role, manager }) {
  if(role === "admin") {
    if(manager) {
      return "Welcome, Boss!"
    }
    return "Welcome, Admin!"
  }
  return "Welcome, User!"
}
```

- Prefer [Early returns / Guard Classes](https://medium.com/@timothydan/javascript-guard-clauses-64b999e3240) 


## Conclusion

Remember all these are suggestions, and **it's okay to be not strict** about something unless you think it will creates some serious issues 
down the line.
