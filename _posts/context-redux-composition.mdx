I was one of the developer who got impacted by the recent layoffs from tech 
companies. So, I started giving interviews for frontend positions with react.

In one of the companies I was given a classic prop drilling problem in react, 
and was asked to solve it. To keep things simple, the problem given was like
this:

```jsx noline
export default function App() {
  const [user, setUser] = React.useState(null);

  const handleLogin = () => setUser(userDetails);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      Company Logo
      <div>
        {user ? (
          <Dashboard user={user} />
        ) : (
          <button onClick={handleLogin}>Login</button>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

function Dashboard({ user }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <DashboardNav user={user} />
    </div>
  );
}

function DashboardNav({ user }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <WelcomeUser user={user} />
      <UserRole user={user} />
    </div>
  );
}

function WelcomeUser({ user }) {
  return <div>Welcome {user.name}</div>;
}

function UserRole({ user }) {
  return <div>Role {user.role}</div>;
}

```

As you can observe, we are passing the `user` prop from `App` component to the 
child components `WelcomeUser` and `UserRole`. The intermediate components `Dashboard` 
and `DashboardNav` are just forwarding the props and not really using it.

This is a classic **prop drilling** issue in react. 

Interestingly, the interviewer asked to solve the problem by either React Context API
or by using Redux.


## Solving by React Context

Using context API to solve this problem would look like the code below.

```jsx highlight={[1,13,15,42,47]}
const UserContext = React.createContext(undefined);

export default function App() {
  const [user, setUser] = React.useState(null);

  const handleLogin = () => setUser(userDetails);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      Company Logo: Context
      <div>
        {user ? (
          <UserContext.Provider value={user}>
            <Dashboard />
          </UserContext.Provider>
        ) : (
          <button onClick={handleLogin}>Login</button>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <DashboardNav />
    </div>
  );
}

function DashboardNav() {
  return (
    <div>
      <WelcomeUser />
      <UserRole />
    </div>
  );
}

function WelcomeUser() {
  const user = React.useContext(UserContext);
  return <div>Welcome {user.name}</div>;
}

function UserRole() {
  const user = React.useContext(UserContext);
  return <div>Role {user.role}</div>;
}
```

We are creating `UserContext` and wrapping the Dashboard with Provider, so that
we can pass the props we want to a deeply nested child component. This solution 
works.

  height={600}
  objectFit='contain'
/>

## Solving by Redux

So, if we are going on the classical redux route, we need to create a similar 
structure and wrap everything with a single global store, which contains the `user` 
object. 

The solution code would contain a ton of boilerplate, as we are using `redux` for 
solving a simple problem.

I just gave the gist of the code below, but if you really want to explore the full
code, here you go: [solving with redux](https://codesandbox.io/s/falling-wave-e5mhrq?file=/src/ReduxWay.js).

```jsx highlight={[3,5,44,45,51,52]}
export default function App() {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <ReduxConnectedApp />
    </Provider>
  );
}

function ReduxApp({ user, setUser }) {
  const handleLogin = () => setUser(userDetails);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      Company Logo: Redux
      <div>
        {user ? <Dashboard /> : <button onClick={handleLogin}>Login</button>}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}


function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <DashboardNav />
    </div>
  );
}

function DashboardNav() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ConnectedWelcomeUser />
      <ConnectedUserRole />
    </div>
  );
}

function WelcomeUser({ user }) {
  return <div>Welcome {user.name}</div>;
}

const mapStateToPropsWelcomeUser = (state) => ({ user: state });
const ConnectedWelcomeUser = connect(mapStateToPropsWelcomeUser)(WelcomeUser);

function UserRole({ user }) {
  return <div>Role {user.role}</div>;
}

const mapStateToPropsUserRole = (state) => ({ user: state });
const ConnectedUserRole = connect(mapStateToPropsUserRole)(UserRole);
```

We have connected the components that needs access to global state
stored in redux. 

## How I solved it

Having read about react composition, I solved the problem by making
use of `children` prop, which looked like this

```jsx highlight={[11,12,13,14,15,16]}
export default function AppSolution() {
  const [user, setUser] = React.useState(null);

  const handleLogin = () => setUser(userDetails);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      Company Logo
      <div>
        {user ? (
          <Dashboard>
            <DashboardNav>
              <WelcomeUser user={user} />
              <UserRole user={user} />
            </DashboardNav>
          </Dashboard>
        ) : (
          <button onClick={handleLogin}>Login</button>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

function Dashboard({ children }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>;
}

function DashboardNav({ children }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>;
}

function WelcomeUser({ user }) {
  return <div>Welcome {user.name}</div>;
}

function UserRole({ user }) {
  return <div>Role {user.role}</div>;
}
```

If you think about it, this is the easy way to solve this problem without introducing
any complexity like `createContext` or `react-redux`. We also get other benefits such
as

- In the future, if we introduce any state inside Dashboard and manipulate it, our 
`DashboardNav` never gets re-rendered.
- By supplying the props **only to the required components**, we have a good visibility 
of all the consumers of `user`, without having to navigate between components (files) to 
look for them.

This pattern is not new, and it's already been talked about in react community. One such
good walkthrough is [Using Composition in React to Avoid "Prop Drilling"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XaXKiXtNjw&ab_channel=ReactTraining)

## Conclusion

However, I got the feedback from the interviewer, and it goes like this

> The interviewee did not understand the problem correctly, and was unable to provide
> the expected solution.

I guess the reason being either the interviewer was not aware of this pattern or I chose
to solve the problem in a way that was not asked for.

Having said that, I am now motivated to write more about interesting patterns in react, hoping
it reaches the wider audience.
