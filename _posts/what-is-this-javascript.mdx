This post summarizes the `this` binding principles explained in the book **this & Object Prototypes, by Kyle Simpson**. It's one of the book in the series _You Don't Know JS_. If you want to learn more about JavaScript from the roots, I highly recommend you reading it.

## Call-Stack and Call-Site

To understand what `this` holds, we first need to understand about call-stack and call-site. 

```javascript
function parent() {
    // call-stack is: `parent`
    // so, our call-site is in the global scope

    console.log( "parent" );
    child(); // <-- call-site for `child`
}

function child() {
    // call-stack is: `parent` -> `child`
    // so, our call-site is in `parent`

    console.log( "child" );
    grandchild(); // <-- call-site for `grandchild`
}

function grandchild() {
    // call-stack is: `parent` -> `child` -> `grandchild`
    // so, our call-site is in `child`

    console.log( "grandchild" );
}

parent(); // <-- call-site for `parent`
```

As we see in the above code, each function has a call-site, that refers to the _site_ it is being called from. `parent()` is called from global scope, and `child()` is called from `parent` scope and so on.

Similarly, call-stack holds the _stack_ of scopes from which the current function is being executed. For, e.g. grandchild has stack `parent` → `child` → `grandchild`

## The Four Rules

The Mystery, 'what `this` refers to?' could be cracked by checking if `this` falls on one of these four rules.

### Default Binding

This is the default rule, which would be applied if none of the other rules seem to apply. 

```javascript
function foo() {
	console.log(this.a);
}

var a = 2;

foo(); // 2
```

In the above snippet, the call-site of `foo()` is in global scope, hence `this` would check for *global object property* with the key `a`. The variables declared in global scope, are same as global object properties. Hence, `a` refers to the global `a`.

> If our `this` execution is in strict mode, this rule would still apply, but global object would return `undefined` instead of `2`.


### Implicit Binding

This rule checks for context object which has `this` execution. In other words, the `this` here refers to the containing object. It's easy to see this in example rather than explaining it with words.

```javascript {2,7}
function foo() {
	console.log(this.a);
}

var obj = {
	a: 2,
	foo: foo
};

obj.foo(); // 2
```

The above snippet has `this` reference, when line number 2 is executed, it's containing object is checked, if it is present, then `this` refers to that object. It can be visualized as below:

```javascript
var obj = {
	a: 2,
	foo: function foo() {
	    console.log(this.a); // this refers to obj
    }
};

obj.foo(); // 2
```

The important thing about this binding is, only the top/last level of the object is considered for `this` binding. 

```javascript
function foo() {
	console.log(this.a);
}

var last = {
	a: 42,
	foo: foo
};

var first = {
	a: 2,
	last: last
};

first.last.foo(); // 42
```

As seen in above snippet, when `this` is encountered in `foo()` the last level object which has `a` is taken as 42 and not the `a` from `first` object.

### Explicit Binding

As the name suggests, JavaScript engine provides us option to explicitly specify an object to be used for `this` reference. `call()` and `apply()` functions are examples for explicitly binding an object to be used for `this` reference.

```javascript
function foo() {
	console.log(this.a);
}

var obj = {
	a: 2
};

foo.call(obj); // 2

var obj2 = {
	a: 55
};

foo.call(obj2); // 55
```

`apply()` function does exactly similar to `call()`, it just differs in the way the additional parameters were passed to that function.

```javascript
// CALL
function foo(arg1, arg2) {
	console.log(this.a + arg1 + arg2);
}

var obj = {
	a: 2
};

foo.call(obj, 2, 2); // 6


// APPLY
function foo(...arr) {
	console.log(this.a + arr[0] + arr[1]);
}

var obj = {
	a: 2
};

foo.apply(obj, [2, 2]); // 6
```

So, structurally, these two executions are equivalent.

```javascript
func.call(thisContext, ...args);
func.apply(thisContext, args);
```

### The `new` Binding

After so many years, ES6 bundled with `class`es out of the box, with which we can create relationships between entities in an _object-oriented_ way. However, strictly speaking, when compared with class-oriented languages like C# or Java, there are **no real classes in JavaScript**.

Okay why are we into class discussion now? What this has to do with `this` in JavaScript?

To understand the fourth rule, we must understand classes, or at least to some extent. We will start with a simple class.

```javascript
class NameBuilder {
    constructor(name){
      this.name = name;
    }

    tellName(){
      console.log('Your name is ' + this.name);
    }
}

const obj = new NameBuilder('Bharathi');

obj.tellName(); // "Your name is Bharathi"
```

When you go through the above example, the following is what you would assume.

When `new` keyword is encountered, JS would call the constructor of our class `NameBuilder`, which sets `this.name` to the value we pass in. Then in the object created, we will have the class method `tellName()` attached to it, and when we execute it, it would print the name set by the constructor. 

Though this is a valid assumption and a valid mental modal, on the interior of JavaScript, it's not how the class instances would be executed. First, there are no constructors in JavaScript. In other words, **constructors are just plain JS functions**.

We will see the same class example with simple function for our understanding.

```javascript
function NameBuilder(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.tellName = function tellName(){
     console.log('Your name is ' + this.name)
  }
}

const obj = new NameBuilder('Bharathi');

obj.tellName(); // "Your name is Bharathi"
```

There is no **constructor** involved here, but the execution works similar to classes. What exactly is happening here?

When a **function** is invoked with `new` in front of it, the following things happen automatically.

1. A Brand **new object** is created (aka, constructed) out of thin air
2. the newly constructed object is **[[Prototype]]-linked**
3. the newly constructed object is set as the `this` binding for that function call
4. unless the function returns its own alternate object, the new-invoked function call will **automatically return the newly constructed object**.

Don't worry, let's follow the steps one by one,

```javascript
const obj = new NameBuilder('Bharathi');

// 1. A Brand **new object** is created (aka, constructed) out of thin air
// creates new object {}

// Lets skip #2 for now

// 3. the newly constructed object is set as the `this` binding
// for that function call
// When the below function is called, `this` points to {}
// Since {} has no `name` or `tellName` properties, they would be set

function NameBuilder(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.tellName = function tellName(){
     console.log('Your name is ' + this.name)
  }
}


// 4. unless the function returns its own alternate object, 
// the new-invoked function call will automatically return the 
// newly constructed object.
// Our function does not return anything, hence, the newly
// created object with two properties, is returned

const obj = new NameBuilder('Bharathi');

// Becomes:

const obj = {
    name: 'Bharathi',
    tellName : tellName() {
        console.log('Your name is ' + this.name)
    }
}

// So, now when we execute `obj.tellName()` which has `this.name` 
//would point to obj.name,

"Your name is Bharathi"
```


Just to make sure it is working as we think, let's tweak that function to return a different object and check.

```javascript
function NameBuilder(name){
  this.name = name;
  this.tellName = function (){
     console.log('Your name is ' + this.name)
  }
  
  return {
     name: "Rajaraam",
     tellName: function tellName() {
       console.log("Your name is " + this.name)
    }
  }
}


const obj = new NameBuilder('Bharathi');

obj.tellName(); // "Your name is Rajaraam"
```

As seen above, as per the point number 4, since the function returns a different object, `this.name` points to `Rajaraam`. The newly created object **{}** is discarded.

Coming back to `new` binding, since `new` is responsible for creating a new object and setting that object as `this` context, this rule is called **new Binding**. 

## Recap

Let's recap the four rules that we saw about `this` binding.

1. Is the function is called with `new` then `this` would be newly constructed object.

```javascript {noline}
 var bar = new foo();
```

2. Is the function is called with explicit bind functions like call or apply? Then, `this` would be the context passed to those functions.

```javascript {noline}
 var bar = foo.call(obj1);
```

3. Is the function executed with containing object? Then `this` would be that object.

```javascript {noline}
 var bar = obj1.foo();
```

4. Otherwise, default binding applies which returns global property, if present in 'non-strict' mode and `undefined` in 'strict' mode.

```javascript {noline}
 var bar = foo();
```

## Arrow Functions

When we read through JavaScript articles on Internet, I'm pretty sure we have gone through the concept of `this`'s behavior with arrow functions. The question to be asked now is, 'How does it play along with the rules mentioned above?' 

The answer is, it **does not**.

The `this` inside an arrow function adopts `this` binding from the enclosing function or global scope. That's it. No other gotchas!

Let's see this with an example.

```javascript {17}
function HOCFunction() {
	// return an arrow function
	return () => {
		// `this` here is lexically adopted from `foo()`
		console.log(this.a);
	};
}

var obj1 = {
	a: 2
};

var obj2 = {
	a: 3
};

var anotherFunction = HOCFunction.call(obj1);

anotherFunction.call(obj2); // 2, not 3
```

We are binding `HOCFunction` to obj1 and saving it in `anotherFunction`.

Now, when we call `anotherFunction` with explicit binding of `obj2`, we expect it to take `this.a` from `obj2`, but it's not. Since this is arrow function, which does not have its own `this`, it would be lexically referenced, in our case from `HOCFunction` and hence it is printed as **2**.

So, instead of returning arrow function, if we have returned normal function, 3 would be printed!

```javascript
function HOCFunction() {
	return function ReturnedFunction(){
		console.log(this.a);
	};
}

var obj1 = {
	a: 2
};

var obj2 = {
	a: 3
};

var anotherFunction = HOCFunction.call(obj1);

anotherFunction.call(obj2); // 3
```

In this case, the `ReturnedFunction` function is a non-arrow function, which has `this` reference.

Let's dig some more to explore `this` in arrow functions, the following example is taken from [arrow function explanation in MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#arrow_functions_used_as_methods)

```javascript
'use strict';

var obj = { // does not create a new scope
  i: 10,
  b: () => console.log(this.i),
  c: function() {
    console.log(this.i);
  }
}

obj.b(); // prints undefined
obj.c(); // prints 10
```

As we can see, `obj.c` has implicit binding rule applied, which points to containing object's `i`, whereas `this` in `obj.b` does not have `this` binding applied, and since there are no enclosing function scope, global scope is applied.

And that is why my friends, we often see the below line in most of the articles written about arrow functions in JavaScript.

> Arrow functions does not have its own `this`

## Closing Notes

I hope, you got to know some rules to apply when you encounter `this` in your project codebases. There are a lot more about `this` to explain in JavaScript, which we skipped in this post just to set the basic foundation. 

Just learning about `this` is not enough, we need to learn to use it, and use it in right sense! We need to explore some real world use cases and patterns that make use of `this` in JavaScript soon! 

Until then, Feel free to explore the book I have attached below to take a deep dive into `this` JavaScript World!
