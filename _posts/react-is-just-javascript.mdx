Let's start this post with a simple function in Javascript.

```javascript
function App(){
  console.log('Hello World'); // logs 'Hello World'
}

App();
```

In the above code snippet, the function call on *line no 5* calls the `App` function
which outputs 'Hello World' in the console. 

## Let's React!

React is simply Javascript. A component defined in React is just a Javascript function.
Consider the React component below.

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <h1>
      Hello World
    </h1>
  );
}
```

This component *renders* `<h1>` with a text 'Hello World' in the Webpage. 

To reiterate,

> A component defined in React is just a Javascript function

Just compare our plain JS code with this react code:

```jsx noline
// JS
function App(){
  return 'Hello World';
}

// React
function App() {
  return (
    <h1>
      Hello World
    </h1>
  );
}
```

Now you would have these questions:

1. This is just a function declaration. Where it is being called?? 
2. If this is a Javascript function then, how HTML is being returned from the function? Is this even valid?
3. Also, Why is it called *rendering*?

Let's answer all these questions.

## 1. Where its being called?

The function `App()` would actually be rendered by `ReactDOM` from react-dom package. 

```jsx highlight={[5]}
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```

The Function App is called here with angle brackets like `<App />` the returned HTML is 
rendered by _ReactDOM_ into the rootElement.

From **React 18**, this has been updated with `createRoot`

```jsx highlight={[5]}
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const container = document.getElementById('root');
const root = createRoot(container);
root.render(<App />);
```

> Read More about `createRoot` on the [react docs](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/createRoot)

This rootElement can be any valid HTML DOM. Usually, we prefer to go with an empty `<div>` with the id root.

```html noline
<div id="root"></div>
```

You should be careful, this should be an empty element because when the rendering occurs, 
this div's [children](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ParentNode/children) would 
be replaced with the tag h1 with text 'Hello World' inserted automatically by React (ReactDOM)

```html highlight={[2]}
<div id="root">
  <h1 class="App">Hello World</h1>
</div>
```

## 2. How HTML is being returned from the function? Is this even valid?

To start off, the *HTML like* thing that is returned from our `App` function is called JSX. 

```jsx highlight={[3,4,5]}
function App() {
  return (
    <h1>
      Hello World
    </h1>
  );
}
```

Technically this JSX is just a *transpiled Javascript function call* (yes it sounds scary). This *HTML like* 
thing is converted to Javascript by a transpiler called **babel** and, Finally the `App` would be sent to JS 
engine like below code that is just **pure javascript**. 

```jsx highlight={[3]}
function App() {
  return (
    React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello World")
  );
}
```

And this is the reason to import _React_ in the module even though we don't explicitly use it.

```jsx highlight={[1]}
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
  );
}
```

[React.createElement](https://react.dev/reference/react/createElement) is top level API provided by react
package to create the corresponding element in Virtual DOM. 

_createElement_ returns React elements, which are plain JS objects that describe the intended structure of the UI.

```jsx
// This JSX syntax:
return  <h1>Hello World</h1>

// is converted to this call:
return  React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello World")

// and that becomes this element object:
{type: 'h1', props: { children: "Hello World" }}
```

> "Babel compiles JSX down to React.createElement() calls." - [Old React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#jsx-represents-objects)

You can play around with Babel and its transpiled code on the [live babel repl](https://babeljs.io/repl). 
To get to know about JSX, head-over to [JSX on react docs](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx).

Also, it is now worth pointing out that with React worked with Babel to introduce **new JSX transform** 
which enables users to write [JSX without even importing React](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html).

Starting with **React 17**, [babel now automatically imports](https://babeljs.io/blog/2020/03/16/7.9.0#a-new-jsx-transform-11154httpsgithubcombabelbabelpull11154) 
_'react'_ when needed. After the new JSX transform, our App component would compile from this

```jsx
// No import 'React' from 'react' needed 

function App() {
  return (
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
  );
}
```

to this

```jsx highlight={[1,5,6,7]}
import { jsx as _jsx } from "react/jsx-runtime";

function App() {
  return (
    _jsx("h1", {
      children: "Hello World"
    });
  );
}
```

React core team is making these [set of changes](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/createlement-rfc/text/0000-create-element-changes.md) gradually 
to remove the need of forwardRef in the future.

And to the most important question,

## 3. Why is it called Rendering ?

In short, Rendering in Web refers to the appearance of something. On a broader picture, the terminology
rendering on the web can mean a lot of things like painting, server-rendering, etc. For our understanding, Let's keep it
short, *Render* refers to appearance of a element, or a set of elements (component) on a webpage.

From the React docs it is clear that React is 

> The library for web and native user interfaces

React helps us build user interfaces, [not only on the Web](https://reactnative.dev/). 
It helps us *render* something on screens that can be presented to the user.

A revisit to the example of ReactDOM API:

```jsx noline
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
```

The ReactDOM **renders** our `<App />` into the `<div>` that we specified.

High level overview of the the rendering process: 

React would create a Virtual DOM in memory which is very similar to the real DOM and renders our `<h1>` tag in the Virtual DOM,
this virtual DOM would be synced with real DOM and during this process `<h1>` tag is added to real DOM. Learn more about how this works on the 
[preserving and resetting state section](https://react.dev/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state).

> The costliest operation on Web is DOM painting and manipulation.

If you are wondering this is *too much boilerplate*, why can't we just simply write HTML files and include Javascript and CSS to make it 
more presentable? 

Yes! You are right, We can easily build a website with plain HTML, JS, and CSS and still make it cool. No one 
can deny it.

Where **our** React shines is, it will drastically simplify **how we render and rerender our elements** by
providing set of **Declarative API**s 

> **Declarative** : You just tell what you need and don't need on DOM and React would take care of that for you!

With the APIs provided by react, we can create **Web Applications** which are highly 
⚡️ **interactive**, 🔥 **performant** and 🚀 **responsive**

If you want some examples, all these following websites are built with 🚀 React

- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/)
- [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/)
- [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/)
- [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/)

Also, keep in mind that,

> For the end-users, it is all just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
