Lets start off this post with the simple function in Javascript.

```javascript
function App(){
  console.log('Hello World'); // logs 'Hello World'
}

App();
```

In the above code snippet, the function call on *line no 5* calls the `App` function
which outputs 'Hello World' in the console. Consider the below function which returns a string:

```javascript
function App(){
  return 'Hello World';
}

const text = App();
console.log(text); // logs 'Hello World'
```

We are storing the value returned from App function in variable `text` and outputting it in the console. 
We know that Javascript is **single threaded** and can execute only one line at a time & the flow of execution 
is top-to-bottom.

When we execute the code, this is what happening in order :

1. The Javascript engine first sees a function declaration from line *1 to 3* 
2. Then goes to line number *5* where it sees a function being called. 
3. Then JS engine **calls** that function and assigns the value returned from that function into the 
`text` variable. 
4. In the next line the text is outputted to the console.

## Enough of JS, Lets React!

React is simply Javascript. A component defined in React is just a Javascript function.
Consider the React component below.

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <h1>
      Hello World
    </h1>
  );
}
```

This component *renders* `<h1>` with text 'Hello World' in the Webpage. 

To reiterate,

> A component defined in React is just a Javascript function

Just compare our plain JS code with this react code:

```jsx noline
// JS
function App(){
  return 'Hello World';
}

// React
function App() {
  return (
    <h1>
      Hello World
    </h1>
  );
}
```

Now you would have these questions:

1. This is just a function declaration. Where it is being called?? 
2. If this is a Javascript function then, how HTML is being returned from the function? Is this even valid?
3. Also why is it called *rendering* ?

Let's answer all these questions.

## 1. Where it is being called?

The function `App()` would actually be rendered by `ReactDOM` from `react-dom` package. 

```jsx {5}
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```

The function `App` is called here with angle brackets like `<App />` the returned *HTML* from `App()` is 
renderd by `ReactDOM` into the `rootElement`.

> Read More about ReactDOM.render() on the [react docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#render)

This rootElement can be any valid HTML DOM. Usually we prefer to go with a empty `<div>` with the id root.

```html noline
<div id="root"></div>
```

You should be careful, this should be an empty element because when the rendering occurs, 
this div's [children](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ParentNode/children) would 
be replaced with the tag h1 with text 'Hello World' inserted automatically by React (ReactDOM)

```html {2}
<div id="root">
  <h1 class="App">Hello World</h1>
</div>
```

## 2. How HTML is being returned from the function? Is this even valid?

To start off, the HTML *like* thing that is returned from our `App` function is called JSX. 

```jsx {3,4,5}
function App() {
  return (
    <h1>
      Hello World
    </h1>
  );
}
```

Technically this JSX is just a *transpiled Javascript function call* (yes it sounds scary). This HTML 
like *thing* is converted to Javascript by a transpiler called **babel** and finally the `App` would be sent to JS 
engine like below code that is just **pure javascript**. 

```jsx {3}
function App() {
  return (
    React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello World")
  );
}
```

[React.createElement](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#createelement) is top level API provided by react
pacakge to create the corresponding element in Virtual DOM. 

> "Babel compiles JSX down to React.createElement() calls." - *[React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#jsx-represents-objects)*

You can play around with Babel and its transpiled code on the [live babel repl](https://babeljs.io/repl). 
To get to know about JSX, headover to [JSX on react docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html).

And to the most important question,

## 3. Why is it called Rendering ?

In short, Rendering in Web refers to the apprearance of something. On a broader picture the terminology
rendering on web can mean a lot of things like painting, server rendering etc. For our understanding lets keep it 
short, *render* refers to appearance of a element, or a set of elements (component) on a webpage.

From the React docs it is clear that React is 

> A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

React helps us build user interfaces, [not only on web](https://reactnative.dev/). 
It helps us *render* something on screens that can be presented to the user.

A revist to the example of ReactDOM API:

```jsx noline
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```

The ReactDOM **renders** our `<App />` into the `<div>` that we specified.

High level overview of the the rendering process: 

React would create a Virtual DOM in memory which is very similar to the real DOM and renders our `<h1>` tag in the Virtual DOM,
this virual DOM would be synced with real DOM and during this process `<h1>` tag is added to real DOM. This process is called 
[Reconciliation](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html)

> The costliest operation on Web is DOM painting and manipulation.

If you are wondering this is *too much boilerplate*, why can't we just simply write HTML files and include Javascript and CSS to make it 
more presentable ? 

Yes! you are right, we can easily build a website with plain HTML, JS and CSS and still make it cool. No one 
can deny it.

Where **our** React shines is, it will drastically simplify **how we render and rerender our elements** by
providing set of **Declarative API**s 

> **Declarative** : You just tell what you need and dont need on DOM and React would take care of that for you!

With the APIs provided by react, we can create **Web Applications** which are highly 
⚡️ **interactive**, 🔥 **performant** and 🚀 **responsive**

If you want some examples, all these following websites are built with 🚀 React

- [Facebook](Facebook)
- [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/)
- [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/)
- [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/)

Also keep in mind that,

> For the end users it is all just HTML, CSS and JavaScript!
