Timer are generally a tricky item for me. The main reason is because of the async nature of it.

A simple interview question we may have come across is to guess the output of some code that plays with `setTimeout` APIs.

```javascript noline
console.log("a");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("c")
}, 3000);

console.log("b");
```

The above code will print a, b and c in order. It prints `c` a little later after printing `a` and `b`. Its due to the timeout API we have used. 

In order to build a simple timer in React, we will follow the following approach.

```jsx
function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('a');
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('c');
    }, 3000);
    console.log('b');

    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }, []);

  return <h1>React Timer</h1>;
}
```

The output you get from the above code would be exactly similar to the one we saw with javascript version we saw above, unless you have enabled [strict mode](TODO LINK).

I am skipping the part why we need a `clearTimeout` and how `strictMode` can help you identify the issues early on development builds. You can read about them on the articles I have mentioned in the references section.

## Timeout Modals

Timeout Modals are very common in a web application that does any of the following tasks

- To let the user know their session is about to expire in "N" seconds.
- To check whether we still have a user in our web application after receiving no response from the users like mousemove, keyboard press etc. This is typically useful in banking applications.
- To let the user know about a redirection to another page.

On all of the above use cases, one thing is common, which is presenting a modal to the user and asking them to take an action before a set time expires. The time coule be 5, 10 or 30 seconds depending on the use case.
