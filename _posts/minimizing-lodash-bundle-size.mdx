When developing a application we would usually be writing some utility functions
that can be reused throughout the application. For example

```javascript
//--------------
// utils.js

function sum(a, b){
    return a + b;
}

function subtract(a, b){
    return a - b;
}

export {
    sum,
    subtract
}

//---------------
// component.js

import {sum, subtract} from 'utils.js';

function calculate(a, b){
    return sum(a, b) + subtract(a, b);
}
```

Lodash is a package that provides a ton of utilities to help us with manipulating the data we have. It has
implementations like _clone, deepClone, isNil, every, sum_ etc. In a large application you would 
import the utilities from lodash like this and use it

```jsx
import { sum } from "lodash";

<Button onClick={() => {
    console.log(sum([1, 2, 3, 3]));
}}> Sum of Array </Button>
```

When we are doing this _named import_ from lodash, we are actually imporing the whole lodash.js file and using just the
sum function from it. 

```javascript
import { sum } from "lodash";

// would be converted to
var lodash = import('lodash');

// and then accessing sum property from lodash
lodash.sum([1, 2, 3, 3])
```

So, with the named exports it is not possible for the bundlers like webpack to treeshake the unwanted code, and we 
end up shipping entire lodash utilities to the user. 

You can avoid this by directly imporing the utility you need from lodash like this

```javascript
import sum from "lodash/sum";
import cloneDeep from "lodash/cloneDeep";
import throttle from "lodash/throttle";
...
```

But this can be tough to maintain, if you are using a lot of utilities from lodash in a file and you would have a bunch
of `import` statements at the top.

Thankfully with babel we have a plugin called [babel-plugin-transform-imports](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-imports),
which, if configured, can transform our named imports to default file imports.

All you have to do is install babel-plugin-transform-imports

```bash {noline}
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-imports
```

and configure babel like this

```javascript
// pacakge.json or .babelrc file

"babel": {
    "plugins": [
        [
            "babel-plugin-transform-imports",
            {
                "lodash": {
                    "transform": "lodash/${member}",
                    "preventFullImport": false
                }
            }
        ]
    ]
}
```

What this essentially does is

```javascript
import { sum } from "lodash";

// would be converted by babel on build step to
import sum from "lodash/sum";

// then on the webpack chunk
var lodash_sum = import('lodash/sum.js');

// and then
lodash_sum([1, 2, 3, 3])
```

Which results in smaller bundle size!

## Let's Measure It

The important step that we need to do while carrying out performance optimizations is to measure it. 

We need to measure the cost before and after introducing a optimization.

If we aren't measuring it, one little mistake with the optimization would cost us additional
performance hit than what was before! So, the rule of the thumb is

> Don't do performance optimizations without measuring it.

Let's create a react app

```bash {noline}
npx create-react-app fresh-cra
```

I am using latest version of [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/), with the below packages

```javascript
"react": "^17.0.2",
"react-dom": "^17.0.2",
"react-scripts": "4.0.3"
```

I am going to install lodash

```bash {noline}
npm install lodash
```

Then, I am going to modify the `App.js` to include the `sum` function

```jsx
import "./App.css";
import { sum } from "lodash";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          console.log(sum([1, 2, 3, 3]));
        }}
      >
        Sum of Array
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now, let's [analyse the bundle size](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size).

For this we would use the package [source-map-explorer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-explorer)
which gives a nice visualisation of the bundles that we ship to the users.

```
npm install --save source-map-explorer
```

Add a new script in package.json

```javascript
"scripts": {
+   "analyze": "source-map-explorer 'build/static/js/*.js'",
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
```

I am going to build the app to create a `/build` folder

```bash {noline}
$ npm run build 

Compiled successfully.
File sizes after gzip:

  65.17 KB  build/static/js/2.ab4556c4.chunk.js
  1.63 KB   build/static/js/3.49b2ab04.chunk.js
  1.17 KB   build/static/js/runtime-main.97cb050d.js
  574 B     build/static/css/main.9d5b29c0.chunk.css
  469 B     build/static/js/main.c3c1410a.chunk.js
```

Now, I am going to run `analyze`

```bash {noline}
npm run analyze
```

Running this command would open a tab in the default browser with the bundle details.

  src="/assets/blog/minimizing-lodash-bundle-size/lodashbefore.png"
  width={700}
  height={300}
  objectFit='contain'
/>

As you can observe, we are shipping ~70 KB of lodash package just for using a simple `sum` utility

## Let's optimize it

I am going to install [babel-plugin-transform-imports](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-imports)

```bash {noline}
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-imports
```

In order to tweak babel configuration without [ejecting](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts#npm-run-eject) from create-react-app, we need to add additional
packages.

```bash {noline}
npm install -D react-app-rewired customize-cra
```

Then create a `config-overrides.js` file in your root directory with this code

```javascript
/* config-overrides.js */
const { useBabelRc, override } = require("customize-cra");

module.exports = override(
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/rules-of-hooks
  useBabelRc()
);
```

Replace `react-scripts` with `react-app-rewired` in package.json

```javascript
- "start": "react-scripts start",
- "build": "react-scripts build",
+ "start": "react-app-rewired start",
+ "build": "react-app-rewired build",
```

The override setup is done, now we can configure babel in create-react-app!

To do that, create a .babelrc file in root directory and use the following code

```javascript
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "babel-plugin-transform-imports",
      {
        "lodash": {
          "transform": "lodash/${member}",
          "preventFullImport": true
        }
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

Now that we are all set, let's run the build

```bash {6}
$ npm run build

Compiled successfully.
File sizes after gzip:

  41.41 KB (-23.75 KB)  build/static/js/2.39f2f9c9.chunk.js
  1.63 KB               build/static/js/3.49b2ab04.chunk.js
  1.17 KB               build/static/js/runtime-main.97cb050d.js
  574 B                 build/static/css/main.9d5b29c0.chunk.css
  472 B (+3 B)          build/static/js/main.9d111c34.chunk.js
```

then 

```bash {noline}
npm run analyze
```

Boom! 

<Image
  alt="Bundle size after optimization"
  src="/assets/blog/minimizing-lodash-bundle-size/lodashafter.png"
  width={700}
  height={300}
  objectFit='contain'
/>


It looks like lodash is gone! Actually it's not. Since the cost of `sum` utility is so small, our 
_source-map-explorer_ isn't showing that up. Right after the build command, you can see the reduction of chunk size by 23 KB.

## Let's explore futher

If you are satisfied with the optimization by looking at the output from _source-map-explorer_ then we are good. 
If you are not, and you are really curious to see the babel magic, let's explore further.

First, let's go back to the state of our application before optimization. 

This is simple for us, just replace `react-app-rewired` with `react-scripts` 

```javascript
- "build": "react-app-rewired build",
+ "build": "react-scripts build",
```

Now, to see the babel transpilation, go to `webpack.config.js` file in `node_modules` directory and look for the object `optimization`
with the key `minimize` then make that as `false`

```javascript
// node_modules/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js

...
return {
    ...
    optimization: {
        minimize: false, //isEnvProduction,
        ...
    }
}
```

This would stop the minification of our source code by webpack, so that we can understand what is shipped to the end-user.

Now, run the build command.

```bash {noline}
$ npm run build

Compiled successfully.

File sizes after gzip:

  142.77 KB (+77.6 KB)  build/static/js/2.b2a9563e.chunk.js
  2.48 KB (+1.31 KB)    build/static/js/runtime-main.51b24467.js
  2.06 KB (+441 B)      build/static/js/3.8a130f73.chunk.js
  960 B (+491 B)        build/static/js/main.1ad88ea0.chunk.js
  625 B (+51 B)         build/static/css/main.9d5b29c0.chunk.css
```

The first thing you can observe here is the increase in bundle size! This is because we are no 
longer minifying our code.

Go into the `/build/static/js` folder and open the main chunk (main.[HASH].chunk.js). 

Search for `lodash`, and you will see the below code

```javascript {8}
...
// EXTERNAL MODULE: ./node_modules/lodash/lodash.js
var lodash = __webpack_require__(4);

...

// sum is accessed as a property from lodash object
("button",{onClick:function onClick(){console.log(Object(lodash["sum"])([1,2,3,3]));},children:"Sum of Array"})
...
```

The one on line number 8 is the transpiled JSX that we wrote. 

> I have already explained about the JSX transpilation in the post [React is Just Javascript](https://www.bharathikannan.com/blog/react-is-just-javascript)

Now, let's do the optimization

```javascript
- "build": "react-scripts build",
+ "build": "react-app-rewired build",
```

and run the build

```bash {noline}
$ npm run build

Compiled successfully.

File sizes after gzip:

  49.64 KB (-93.13 KB)  build/static/js/2.08144287.chunk.js
  2.48 KB               build/static/js/runtime-main.51b24467.js
  2.06 KB               build/static/js/3.8a130f73.chunk.js
  965 B (+5 B)          build/static/js/main.22f99645.chunk.js
  625 B                 build/static/css/main.9d5b29c0.chunk.css
```

Let's check the transpiled chunk (`/build/static/js/main.22f99645.chunk.js`)

```javascript {1,6}
// EXTERNAL MODULE: ./node_modules/lodash/sum.js
var sum = __webpack_require__(4);
var sum_default = /*#__PURE__*/__webpack_require__.n(sum);

// default sum is called
("button",{onClick:function onClick(){console.log(sum_default()([1,2,3,3]));},children:"Sum of Array"})
```

Did you notice the difference in the code that we shipped? 

Instead of importing everything from lodash.js we are now importing from lodash/sum.js.

Now we can be confident that the babel transform is working as expected.
