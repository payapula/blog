Lets start with the simple and basic function in Javascript.

```javascript
function add(a, b){
  console.log(a + b); // logs 9
}

add(4, 5);
```

In the above code snippet, the function call on *line no 5* calls the `add` function
with the arguments 4 and 5 which outputs the sum 9 to the console. Consider the below 
function which returns a value.

```javascript
function add(a, b){
  return a + b;
}

const sum = add(4, 5);
console.log(sum); // logs 9
```

We are storing the value in the variable `sum` and outputting it in the console. We 
know that Javascript is single threaded and can execute only one line at a time & the flow of execution 
is top-to-bottom.

When we execute the code, this is what happening in order :

1. The Javascript engine first sees a function declaration from line *1 to 3* 
2. Then goes to line number *5* where it sees a function being called. 
3. Then JS engine **calls** that function and assigns the value returned from that function into the 
`sum` variable. 
4. In the next line the sum is outputted to the console.

So far so good. If we didn't return anything from a function it is would be 
implicilty `undefined`.

```javascript
function add(a, b){
  console.log(a + b); // logs 9
  // return undefined implied
}

const sum = add(4, 5);
console.log(sum) // logs undefined
```

## Enough of JS, Lets React!

React is simply Javascrip. A component defined in React is just a Javascript function.
Consider the React component below.

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <h1>
      Hello World
    </h1>
  );
}
```

This component *renders* `<h1>` with *Hello World* in the Webpage. 

To reiterate,

> A component defined in React is just a Javascript function

If you compare our plain JS code with this react code, you would have these questions

1. This is just a function declaration. Where it is being called?? 
2. If this is a Javascript function then, how HTML is being returned from the function? Is this even valid?
3. Also why it is called *rendering* ?

Let's answer all these questions in this post.

## Where it is being called?

The function `App()` would actually be rendered by `ReactDOM` from `react-dom` package. 

```jsx
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```

The *HTML* that is being returned from `App()` is renderd by `ReactDOM` into the rootElement.
This rootElement can be any valid HTML DOM. Usually we prefer to go with a empty `<div>` with the id root.

```html noline
<div id="root"></div>
```

You should be careful, this should be an empty element because when the rendering occurs, 
this div's [children](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ParentNode/children) would 
be replaced with the tag h1 with text 'Hello World' inserted automatically by React (ReactDOM)

```html {2}
<div id="root">
  <h1 class="App">Hello World</h1>
</div>
```

## How HTML is being returned from the function? Is this even valid?

To start off, the HTML *like* thing that is returned from our `App` function is called JSX. 

```jsx {3,4,5}
function App() {
  return (
    <h1>
      Hello World
    </h1>
  );
}
```

Technically this JSX is just a *transpiled Javascript function call* (yes it sounds scary). This HTML 
like *thing* is converted to Javascript by a transpiler called **babel** and finally the `App` would be sent to JS 
engine like below code that is just **pure javascript**. 

```jsx {3}
function App() {
  return (
    React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello World")
  );
}
```

[React.createElement](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#createelement) is top level API provided by react
pacakge to create the corresponding element in Virtual DOM. 

> "Babel compiles JSX down to React.createElement() calls." - *[React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#jsx-represents-objects)*

You can play around with Babel and its transpiled code [here](https://babeljs.io/repl). Also get to know about [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html).

And to the most important question,

## Why it is called **Rendering** ?

In short, Rendering in Web refers to the apprearance of something. With a broader picture the terminology
rendering on web can mean a lot of things like painting, server rendering etc. For our understanding lets keep it 
short, `render` refers to appearance of a element, or a set of elements (component) on a webpage.

From the React docs it is clear that React is 

> A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

React helps us build user interfaces, [not only on web](https://reactnative.dev/). 
It helps us *render* something on screens that can be presented as webpage.

When served from a server, both of these are same
- A simple HTML file with the text Hello World is also *rendering* a website
- Our React code that gets transpiled to JS with the text Hello world is also *rendering* a website 

So if both are same then we can just simply write HTML files and include Javascript and CSS to make it 
more presentable right? 

Yes! you are right, we can easily build a website with plain HTML, JS and CSS and still make it cool. No one 
can deny it.

Where **our** React outshines is it can drastically simplify **how we render and rerender our elements** by
providing set of **Declarative API**s 

With the APIs provided by react, we can create **Web Applications** which are highly 
⚡️ **interactive**, 🔥 **performant** and 🚀 **responsive**

Also keep in mind that,
