A lot of things need to be taken into consideration while designing any software application in general. 
To build a website with the component-based development approach, 
we would tend to approach a design as individual components.

For example, consider a super simple website like a blog. It would typically have a header, post cover,
 post content, a footer, links to navigate between different posts, a search component to search the available posts, and so on.

When we are presented with a design of a website, we would start building up the small 
individual parts of it, which we refer to as components and then fuse those components 
together to complete the design for a page.

Suppose, if we want to build a button then it is super simple like

```html {noline}
  <button onclick="alert('hello world');">Hello</button>
```

This is a simple HTML tag, an element, and also a component. There can be a lot of components 
we will want to build for a real client application. Some of the examples are modals, 
drawers, links, tabs, inputs etc.

When building these components we should be careful that we are following same design
architecture throughout our application. All the buttons in our application must *look and feel the same*.

Next thing to be taken for consideration while developing web applications is *Web Accessibility*. 
If we are building a dropdown/select component, it must be navigatable via keyboard, should have
proper color contrast, accessible by screen readers etc. 

There could be many other cases that we may not even aware of while building some complex components like 
tabs, overlays, modals.

To help us solve these problems and to easily get started with development, there are a lot 
of **UI Component Libraries** out there. They have a lot of battle tested components, which would help the developers 
like us to build our application quickly without sacrificing on accessibility, design architecture, meaningful
navigation and so on.

One of such component Library is [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/).

Think of these building blocks like set of lego blocks. We can start picking the right ones we need
and compose them together to make our dream project!

## A Re-Introduction to CSS in React

Before we see about Chakra UI, let's revisit on the ways that we can style our React components 
with css.

### External styles

In this approach, we would write our component code in a JSX or TSX files and we would create another file 
with css and reference them in our component file.

```bash {noline}
components
  - mycomponent.jsx
  - mycomponent.css
```

The challenge with this approach is that the _css_ we are writing is *not scoped* to the component, rather it would
be applied globally. When we are selecting the elements with _classname_ or _IDs_ and writing specific styles,
we should be careful to *not repeat the same selectors*. If we are not careful enough then wrong 
styles would be applied to a element with same selector name on a different page. This is because our entire css 
files are bundled together and server over the wire.

Another big headache is when we are removing some components from our application,
it is so very easy to *forget about the styles* that we wrote for that component. 
Since the styles are not scoped to the component, we have no way to find out the dead css 
in our application.

### CSS In JS

As the name suggests, in this approach, we would be writing CSS code in Javascript! 

This has a lot of benefits, like

1. Easy Maintenance
2. Fast Performance 
3. Dynamic Styling

When we scope the css to a particular component, we no longer have to worry about
our _styles messing up other components_. When we remove a component from the application,
the _css goes away_ with that! The major benefit of it is _sending just the CSS that we need for the page_ over the 
wire. 

There are a lot of libraries to help us with the css-in-js approach. The 
famous ones are [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction).

A [simple example of CSS-In-JS with emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/css-prop#object-styles)

<Image
  alt="CSS-In-Js with Emotion"
  src="/assets/blog/simple-introduction-to-chakra/emotion-css-in-js-example.png"
  width={1500}
  height={600}
  objectFit='contain'
/>

You can see the difference in the casing of the css properties, `backgroundColor` instead of 
`background-color` and pseudo selectors as well. We are passing styles as a object to
a custom prop `css` which is inferred by emotion and applies those styles _inline_ to that
`div`.

> If you want to have a deep dive on this concept, please read thorough the
> [documentation from emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction)

We can build our react application with emotion or styled components, but the Chakra UI library 
takes this approach a one level higher and simpler.

## Getting Started with Chakra UI

The above example with emotion's css prop can be achieved in Chakra UI with the 
below piece of code.

```jsx
import { Box } from "@chakra-ui/react";

return (
    <Box
      backgroundColor="hotpink"
      _hover={{
        color: "lightgreen"
      }}
    >
      This has a hotpink background.
    </Box>
);
```

Here we are passing in the styles directly to the component `<Box/>` as props. The Box
component renders a `div` by default. 

Chakra UI uses emotion under the hood, so you can also style your components in
pure emotion way, but you won't be needing this for the most part.

This is chakra component styled with emotion.

```jsx
return (
    <Box
      css={{
        backgroundColor: "hotpink",
        "&:hover": {
          color: "lightgreen"
        }
      }}
    >
      This has a hotpink background.
    </Box>
);
```

Both renders the same result.

Let's see another example, where we want to get username and password in a form
with a submit button.

In React with plain elements,

<Image
  alt="Styling in react"
  src="/assets/blog/simple-introduction-to-chakra/react-example.png"
  width={1400}
  height={700}
  objectFit='contain'
/>

Same element styles in Chakra would be

<Image
  alt="Styling in chakra"
  src="/assets/blog/simple-introduction-to-chakra/chakra-example.png"
  width={1400}
  height={700}
  objectFit='contain'
/>

_Note: Please ignore the semantics here, as this is just to demonstrate comparison of styles_

If the images aren't clear, take a look at the Sandboxes for [Plain React](https://codesandbox.io/s/sad-tesla-5zwuy) and 
with [Chakra UI](https://codesandbox.io/s/immutable-butterfly-sfjpi) components mentioned above.

There are a lot of components we have in chakra and even specific ones like `Grid` and `Flex`
to handle layouts exclusively like these. 

The awesome part of using Chakra components is the _intellisense for the styles_ are 
always available for you so that you need not worry about the casing of styles. 

The point here is chakra is well documented, and you can easily peek into any
of the components from the [chakra ui repo](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui) 
to learn more about them, and to customize according to your requirements.

In the above form example with chakra, we have seen a component `<chakra.form/>` which
simply renders HTML `<form>` but the beauty is, it can accept chakra's style props.
We can convert any custom component to receive chakra props with the `chakra` function. 
Similar in function to `styled` in emotion.

```jsx
import styled from '@emotion/styled'

const Button = styled.button`
  color: turquoise;
`
render(<Button>This my button component.</Button>)
```

## Accessibility ❤️

Chakra components are built with accessibility in mind 🚀. For an example, if you are
using modal from chakra, these are the keyboard and focus management you get out 
of the box which complies with accessible standards:

- When the modal opens, focus is trapped within it.
- When the modal opens, focus is automatically set to the first enabled element.
- When the modal closes, focus returns to the element that was focused before
  the modal activated.
- Clicking on the overlay closes the Modal.
- Pressing `Esc` closes the Modal.
- Scrolling is blocked on the elements behind the modal.
- The modal is rendered in a portal attached to the end of `document.body` to
  break it out of the source order and make it easy to add `aria-hidden` to its
  siblings.

There is special component `<VisuallyHidden/>` which is not visible to the normal
user but would be accessible by screen readers. This is useful for providing 
additional details to a icon button or image which cannot be perceived by visually 
challenged users. Though this can be achieved with 10 lines of css, kudos to chakra
team for thinking about it and providing it as a component 💯 

## Dark Mode 🌗

All the chakra UI components are dark mode compatible, the colors & default styles
are easily overridable. 

With the excellent community support and documentation, you can build out
awesome components with just minimal amount of time.

You would have guessed by now, still to mention,
