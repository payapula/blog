  <Answer>
    Again, No magic. React would render a `div` with the children "Hello World".

  What will be the output of the following code after compilation?

  ```jsx noline
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  ```

    <Choise isAnswer>
     `React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello World")`

    <Choise >
     `React.createElement("h1", null, ["Hello World"])`
    </Choise>
    <Choise>
     `React.createElement("<h1/>", null, {"Hello World"})`
    </Choise>
    <Choise>
     `React.createElement("jsx.h1", null, {jsx:"Hello World"})`
    </Choise>
  </Choises>
  <Answer>
    `React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello World")`

    Since we have `Hello World` string, the third argument of createElement would
    be a simple "string".

  <Question>
    Is this valid React JSX?

    ```jsx
    function App() {
        return "Hello World"

    <Choise isAnswer>
     Valid
    </Choise>
    <Choise >
     Invalid
    </Choise>
  </Choises>
  <Answer>
    It's valid because react renders a string from the component. 

    On the HTML, it would look like this

    ```html
      <div id="root">Hello world</div>
    ```

  <Answer>
    It's valid because react treats each number as child element and renders like below:

    ```html
     <div id="root">123</div>

    If you try that, you'll see a error message on the console,

    > Error: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {}). If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead.

    This is because, React expects components to return either a single React element, an array of elements, or a string (or number) representing a single element.
    
    When you return an array `[1, 2, 3]` from a component, React treats each element of the array as a separate child component and renders them accordingly. In contrast, when you return an object `{}` from a component, React doesn't know how to render it because it's not a valid React element.
