    Because of this

      ```js
      // JS
      function App(){
        return 'Hello World';
      }

      // React
      function App() {
        return (
          <h1>
            Hello World
          </h1>
        );
      }

  <Answer>
    The code above will output: `undefined, 5000$` because of hoisting. In the code presented above, you might be expecting salary to retain it values from outer scope until the point that salary was re-declared in the inner scope. But due to hoisting salary value was undefined instead. 
    
    To understand it better have a look of the following code, here salary variable is hoisted and declared at the top in function scope. When we print its value using console.log the result is undefined. Afterwards the variable is redeclared and the new value "5000$" is assigned to it.

      ```javascript highlight={[4]}
     var salary = "1000$";

    (function () {
      var salary = undefined;
      console.log("Original salary was " + salary);

      salary = "5000$";

      console.log("My New Salary " + salary);
    })();
      ```
